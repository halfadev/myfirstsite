    <p><em>This website is an attempt to teach myself how to code.
      Despite a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I haven't written a line
      of code in years. Until now </em></p><br>

    <h3>My Intrests: What do I like?</h3>
    <p><em>My interests have evolved in the first 30 years of my life. They
    are, in no particular order: </em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding Technology</li>
      <li>Writing about Human Experiences</li>
      <li>Traveling the world</li>
      <li>Gaining Financial Freedom</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I guess goals 3 and 4 are something everyone has in their life in one
    form or the other.</p>

    <h3>My Skills: What am I good at?</h3>
    <p>If you're looking for ransom, I can tell you that I don't have money
      But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have
      acquired over a very long career, skills that make
      me a nightmare for people like you. </p><br>
